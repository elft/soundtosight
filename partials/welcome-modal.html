                <h2>Experience Music with All Your Senses</h2>
                <p>Music has always been a journey for the ears, but what if you could <em>see</em> the rhythm,
                    <em>witness</em> the bass, and <em>watch</em> the melody dance before your eyes?</p>
                <p>Sound to Sight transforms your favorite music into a living, breathing visual experience. Each
                    beat becomes a pulse of light, every frequency a wave of color, and the entire composition a
                    symphony for your eyes.</p>
                <p class="highlight">When sound and sight unite, music transcends the auditory ‚Äî it becomes
                    <strong>immersive art</strong>.
