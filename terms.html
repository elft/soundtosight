        <h1>Terms of Service &amp; User Agreement</h1>

        <div class="notice">
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> By accessing or using Vvavy (“the Service”), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Service &amp; User Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use or access the Service.
        </div>

        <h2>1. About the Service</h2>
        <p>Vvavy is an experimental web-based audio visualization experience operated by an independent creator (“we”, “us”, “our”). The Service transforms audio input into visual output for personal enjoyment. The Service is offered “as-is” without any guarantees.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old, or the minimum age required by your jurisdiction, to use the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of another person or entity, you represent that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on their behalf.</p>

        <h2>3. Personal, Non-Commercial Use</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided solely for personal, non-commercial use. You may not resell, sublicense, rent, lease, or otherwise exploit the Service or its output for commercial purposes without prior written permission.</p>

        <h2>4. Audio Content Responsibility</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for any audio content you upload, stream, or otherwise supply to the Service. You must ensure you have all necessary rights and authorizations to use such content. We do not host or store user audio; processing occurs client-side within your browser environment.</p>

        <h2>5. Health &amp; Safety</h2>
        <p>The Service may contain flashing lights, rapid motion, intense colors, and other visual effects that could trigger seizures or other adverse reactions in susceptible individuals. Use the Service in a safe environment, take frequent breaks, and discontinue use immediately if you experience any discomfort, dizziness, disorientation, or other health symptoms.</p>

        <h2>6. No Warranties</h2>
        <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR FREE FROM HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE OWNER, CONTRIBUTORS, AND AFFILIATES OF THE SERVICE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

        <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the owner, contributors, partners, and affiliates from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Service, your violation of this Agreement, or your infringement of any third-party right.</p>

        <h2>9. Assumption of Risk</h2>
        <p>You expressly acknowledge and agree that your use of the Service is at your sole risk. You assume full responsibility for any risks associated with your use, including but not limited to hardware damage, eye strain, motion sickness, seizures, or other adverse health outcomes.</p>

        <h2>10. Service Modifications &amp; Availability</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (in whole or in part) at any time without notice. We are not liable to you or any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service.</p>

        <h2>11. Updates to this Agreement</h2>
        <p>We may update this Agreement from time to time. The “Last updated” date indicates the most recent revision. Continued use of the Service after any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Agreement.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the owner resides, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes must be resolved exclusively in the courts located within that jurisdiction.</p>

        <h2>13. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>

        <h2>14. Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this Agreement, please contact the project owner through the GitHub repository issue tracker found at <a href="https://vvavy.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://vvavy.io</a>.</p>
