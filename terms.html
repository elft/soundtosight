    <p class="muted">Welcome to VVavy (“<strong>VVavy</strong>”, “we”, “us”). This page contains our Terms of Service
      and Privacy Notice. By using VVavy, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <section id="tos">
      <h2>1) Terms of Service</h2>
      <h3>1.1 About the Service</h3>
      <p>VVavy is an experimental, web-based audio visualization experience. It transforms audio input into real-time
        visuals for personal enjoyment. The Service is provided “as-is.”</p>

      <h3>1.2 Eligibility</h3>
      <p>You must be at least 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). If you use VVavy for an organization, you
        confirm you’re authorized to accept these terms.</p>

      <h3>1.3 Personal, Non-Commercial Use</h3>
      <p>Use VVavy for personal, non-commercial purposes unless you have our prior written permission. Do not resell,
        sublicense, rent, or lease the Service or its outputs.</p>

      <h3>1.4 Your Audio Content</h3>
      <p>You are responsible for any audio you supply. Ensure you hold all necessary rights for any use (e.g., public
        performance, synchronization if applicable).</p>

      <h3>1.5 Health & Safety</h3>
      <p>Visuals may include flashing, motion, or intense color. Stop use if you experience discomfort. Use in a safe
        environment and take breaks.</p>

      <h3>1.6 Modifications & Availability</h3>
      <p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue parts or all of VVavy at any time.</p>

      <h3>1.7 No Warranties</h3>
      <p>
        THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN <strong>“AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”</strong> BASIS. VVAVY <strong>DISCLAIMS ALL
          WARRANTIES</strong>, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF
        TRADE. VVAVY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE <strong>ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR
          COMPATIBLE</strong> WITH THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS, OR THAT <strong>EXPORTS</strong> WILL BE ACCEPTED BY ANY
        DESTINATION PLATFORM.
      </p>

      <h3>1.8 Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, VVAVY AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY <strong>INDIRECT,
          INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE</strong> DAMAGES, OR FOR <strong>LOSS OF PROFITS,
          REVENUE, GOODWILL, DATA, OR USE</strong>, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
        VVAVY’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE IN ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD WILL NOT EXCEED THE
        GREATER OF <strong>USD $100</strong> OR THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO VVAVY FOR THE SERVICE IN THAT PERIOD (IF ANY).
        THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
        <strong>Nothing in this Section limits liability</strong> for fraud, willful misconduct, or injury where such
        limitation is prohibited by law.
      </p>


      <h3 id="release">1.8A Release; Assumption of Risk</h3>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, you <strong>release and discharge</strong> VVavy from any and all claims
        and liabilities arising out of or relating to your use of the Service, including exposure to <em>flashing or
          intense visuals</em>, motion, or color effects, and any actions you take with your exports. You understand
        that using audio-reactive visuals can present <strong>health and safety risks</strong> (e.g., photosensitivity,
        motion sickness, disorientation), and you <strong>assume all such risks</strong> and agree to use the Service
        responsibly and in a safe environment.
      </p>


      <h3>1.10 Governing Law</h3>
      <p>Unless mandatory law says otherwise, these terms are governed by the laws of the owner’s domicile, and disputes
        are heard in those courts.</p>

      <h3>1.11 Severability & Changes</h3>
      <p>If any provision is unenforceable, the rest remain in effect. We may update these terms; continued use means
        you accept the changes.</p>

      <h3 id="exports">1.12 Exports, Synchronization & Music Licensing</h3>
      <p><strong>Exports that include audio:</strong> If you choose to export visuals together with audio, you are
        solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining <em>all</em> rights necessary for that use, including without
        limitation synchronization and, where applicable, master use licenses, public performance rights, and any
        platform-specific clearances. You must not include any audio in an export unless you are the rights holder or
        have all required licenses for that specific pairing of audio and visuals.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Default behavior:</strong> Exports may be muted by default when created from third-party streams or
          where licensing status is unknown.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform rules:</strong> You agree to comply with the upload and music policies of destinations, and
          you acknowledge that platforms may block or remove your exports.</li>
        <li><strong>Geo/territory:</strong> You are responsible for territorial restrictions and any collecting-society
          obligations that apply to your export.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="user-reps">1.13 Your Representations & Warranties (Audio & Likeness)</h3>
      <p>You represent and warrant that: (a) you own or have obtained all permissions, licenses, and clearances
        necessary to upload audio, pair it with visuals, and export it; (b) your use and exports do not infringe or
        misappropriate any copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other right; (c) you will not use the name, image,
        voice, or likeness of any person without consent, including publicity and privacy rights recognized under
        applicable law; and (d) your use complies with all laws, rules, and platform policies.</p>

      <h3 id="prohibited">1.14 Prohibited Uses (Exports & Audio)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No uploading or exporting audio you do not have rights to synchronize.</li>
        <li>No “stream-ripping”, downloading, or making permanent copies of third-party streams except as expressly
          permitted by rights holders.</li>
        <li>No removing or altering attribution, watermarks, identifiers, or rights-management information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="dmca">1.15 Copyright Policy (DMCA)</h3>
      <p>We respect intellectual-property rights and will respond to clear notices of alleged infringement consistent
        with 17 U.S.C. §512. We may remove or disable access to material alleged to be infringing and may terminate
        repeat infringers.</p>
      <p><strong>Submit a DMCA notice</strong> to our designated agent with: (1) the work claimed to be infringed; (2)
        identification of the material or link to be removed; (3) contact information; (4) a statement of good-faith
        belief; (5) a statement under penalty of perjury that the notice is accurate and you are authorized; and (6) a
        physical or electronic signature. Counter-notices must comply with §512(g).</p>
      <div class="notice">
        <p><strong>Designated Agent for DMCA Notices</strong><br>
          Name: VVavy DMCA Agent<br>

          Address: <em>[Insert physical mailing address]</em></p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="repeat">1.16 Repeat-Infringer Policy</h3>
      <p>Accounts that receive multiple valid notices or otherwise repeatedly infringe may have features limited
        (including export and streaming) or accounts terminated, at our discretion.</p>

      <h3 id="publicity">1.17 Right of Publicity & Likeness</h3>
      <p>Using a person’s name, image, voice, or likeness (including in your exports) may require consent. You must
        obtain and keep any required permissions or releases. You may not upload or export content that exploits another
        person’s identity without authorization, consistent with rights recognized under Minnesota law.</p>

      <h3 id="no-legal-advice">1.18 No Legal Advice</h3>
      <p>VVavy does not provide legal advice. You are responsible for your own compliance and for obtaining legal
        counsel regarding licensing, rights-clearance, privacy, and publicity issues related to your audio and exports.
      </p>

      <h3 id="no-reverse">1.19 No Reverse Engineering & Client-Side Tampering</h3>
      <p>Except to the limited extent expressly permitted by applicable law (and then only after providing us prior
        written notice), you must not do any of the following in relation to VVavy, its client-side code, or any
        associated services/APIs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reverse engineering:</strong> reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to
          derive source code, algorithms, models, audio-analysis pipelines, visualizers/shaders, or any non-public
          interfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Circumvention:</strong> bypass, defeat, or disable any access control, authentication, rate
          limiting, watermarking, origin checks, DRM, or other technical protection measures (including prohibitions
          under 17 U.S.C. §1201).</li>
        <li><strong>Tampering:</strong> intercept, modify, inject, or tamper with client-side code, network traffic,
          local storage, or runtime execution (e.g., devtools overrides, user scripts, MITM proxies) to alter behavior,
          disable limits, remove watermarks, or access non-public features or data.</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized automation/scraping:</strong> crawl, scrape, spider, frame, mirror, bulk export, or
          harvest any part of the Service or its outputs except through documented features and permitted public APIs.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Derivative works & redistribution:</strong> copy, adapt, or create derivative works from VVavy’s
          code, designs, or assets, or redistribute any part of the client bundle, except as explicitly allowed by us in
          writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Abuse of limits:</strong> use bots or automated means to create accounts/sessions, to record
          streams, or to evade quotas, geographic/territorial restrictions, or usage rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Security testing:</strong> perform vulnerability scanning, fuzzing, load testing, or other security
          testing without our prior written authorization. For coordinated disclosure, contact <a
            href="mailto:vvavy.io@gmail.com">vvavy.io@gmail.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Attribution removal:</strong> remove, obscure, or alter any attribution, copyright notice,
          watermark, or rights-management information displayed by the Service or in exports.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any unauthorized access, interference, or circumvention may violate civil and criminal laws (including the
        Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) and is grounds for suspension or termination and other remedies.</p>

      <h2>2) SoundCloud Streaming Rules</h2>
      <p class="notice">When you visualize audio sourced from SoundCloud, the following terms apply in addition to
        SoundCloud’s own API Terms and User Terms. VVavy is not affiliated with or endorsed by SoundCloud.</p>

      <h3>2.1 Access & Availability</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>VVavy accesses SoundCloud audio solely via SoundCloud’s public APIs and only for real-time, client-side
          visualization.</li>
        <li>Playback is attempted only for tracks where the uploader has enabled API playback. If a track is removed or
          API access is disabled, availability will cease promptly.</li>
        <li>SoundCloud Go-only content is not accessible via VVavy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Strictly No Downloading, Caching, or “Stream Ripping”</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No saving, downloading, recording, ripping, or making permanent copies</strong> of SoundCloud audio.
        </li>
        <li>Only ephemeral, session-bound buffering is permitted to the extent necessary for playback; all such data is
          discarded when the session ends.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Exports & “Muted by Default” Rule</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When you export visuals that were created from SoundCloud streams, exports are <strong>muted by
            default</strong>.</li>
        <li>Embedding SoundCloud audio in an export is permitted only where you are the rights holder (or have all
          required rights, including synchronization) for the audio.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.4 Attribution & Backlink</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>VVavy displays: (a) the SoundCloud uploader as the creator, (b) SoundCloud as the source, and (c) a visible
          link to the track’s SoundCloud permalink.</li>
        <li>Where feasible, we use official SoundCloud components/buttons per their branding rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.5 Prohibited Uses (SoundCloud)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No use of SoundCloud audio to train or develop any AI/ML models; no creating fingerprints or similar
          identifiers for exploitation.</li>
        <li>No scraping, webcasting/radio apps, or attempts to bypass territorial/time restrictions, rate limits, ads,
          or content protection.</li>
        <li>No advertising/sponsorship wrapped around third-party SoundCloud content played via VVavy.</li>
        <li>No use of SoundCloud trademarks or logos except as allowed by their branding rules; no implication of
          endorsement.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="privacy">
      <h2>3) Privacy Notice</h2>
      <p class="muted">This Privacy Notice explains what we process, why, for how long, your rights, and how to contact
        us. For SoundCloud-linked features, VVavy acts as an <strong>independent controller</strong> of any Personal
        Data we process through SoundCloud’s APIs.</p>

      <h3>3.1 What We Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> basic telemetry (e.g., errors, feature toggles) to keep VVavy reliable.</li>
        <li> We do not store audio files.</li>
        <li> We do not store microphone input.</li>
        <li> Everything is processed in real time on the user's device.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 Purposes & Legal Bases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide the Service:</strong> enable real-time visualization and lawful playback; show
          attribution/permalinks.</li>
        <li><strong>Security & abuse prevention:</strong> protect against misuse and keep the Service available.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> meet SoundCloud API rules and applicable law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.3 Retention</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We retain data only as long as necessary for the stated purposes.</li>
        <li>On disconnect, SoundCloud-derived Personal Data is deleted within <strong>7 days</strong> (unless longer
          retention is legally required).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.4 Security</h3>
      <p>We implement technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk (e.g., transport encryption, secret
        management, least-privilege access, and vulnerability remediation). If legally required, we will notify you and
        any relevant parties of a Personal Data breach.</p>

      <h3>3.5 Your Rights</h3>
      <p>Subject to local law, you may request access, correction, deletion, or restriction, and where applicable,
        object to processing or request portability. To exercise rights, contact <a
          href="mailto:vvavy.io@gmail.com">vvavy.io@gmail.com</a>. You may also lodge a complaint with your data
        protection authority.</p>

      <h3>3.6 Children</h3>
      <p>VVavy is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). Do not use VVavy if you
        are under that age.</p>

      <h3>3.7 Changes</h3>
